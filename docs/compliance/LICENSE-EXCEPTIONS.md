# License exceptions register

Items that deviate from the default "original code under the project license, permissive third-party
dependencies with notices" and are knowingly accepted, each with its condition. An entry with
**Owner approval: pending** is proposed, not accepted. Owner decision 2026-10-16: EX-02…EX-06 accepted
subject to their conditions; the PCI fixture was replaced rather than kept (EX-05 closed).
