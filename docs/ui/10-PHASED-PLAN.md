# 10. Phased implementation and migration strategy (planning)

Nothing in this plan is implemented or authorised. Each phase needs owner approval and fits within
milestone gates (M2 remains on hold). Every phase keeps the M1 UI working; there is no big-bang rewrite.

| Phase | Scope | Exit criteria | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **U0 — Decisions** | LA-03 MIT scope (**decided** 2026-10-16), LA-06 system fonts preferred (**decided**; removal plan in `docs/compliance/LICENSE-AUDIT.md`), `.hltheme` single JSON (**accepted in principle**, ADR 0010), layout preferences separate from themes (**decided**), CSSOM under CSP (**verified**, `tests/e2e/theme_cssom_csp.py`). Open: approval of U1 and the token schema | Decisions recorded in ADRs | This PR |
| **U1 — Token foundation** | Rename/alias M1 tokens to the `02` taxonomy; generate `default`, `oled`, `high-contrast` from JSON at build time; contrast tests in CI; settle schema v1 | Visual parity with M1 (screenshots), axe clean, all built-in themes pass contrast | U0 |
| **U2 — Runtime theme switching** | Client theme engine (validate → resolve → CSSOM apply), appearance settings (mode, motion, contrast) and separate layout preferences (density, navigation; `06` §6.5), `prefers-*` support; per-browser storage only | Theme switch ≤ 16 ms, no CSP change, malicious corpus rejected | U1 |
| **U3 — Data layer & shell** | `useResource` store replacing per-page polling; responsive shell, navigation, command palette (navigation only) | Budgets in `08` met; keyboard e2e; no regressions in M1 checks | U1 (parallel to U2) |
| **U4 — Dashboards** | Widget registry, default dashboard, edit mode with keyboard alternative; layouts stored client-side until M2 settings store exists | Error boundaries, pausing verified; e2e at three viewports | U3 |
| **U5 — Server-side preferences** | Settings store, theme/dashboard persistence, server-side validator, audit events | Security review; part of M2 or later per owner | M2 approval |
| **U6 — Theme Studio** | Editor per `03`, import/export `.hltheme` | Full validator test corpus; accessibility review of the Studio | U2, U5 |
| **U7 — Live telemetry** | SSE metrics endpoint, ring buffers, charts | Server limits tested; idle CPU budget met | M2 security review |
| **U8 — Plugin widgets** | Manifest-declared widgets from reviewed plugin bundles | Plugin SDK and signing in place | M3 |

## Migration rules
- Existing M1 pages (Overview, Services, Hardware, Webmin status) are ported one at a time onto the new
  shell and data layer; each port must keep its e2e and axe checks green.
- Token aliases from M1 names stay for one minor release after U1, then are removed with a migrator.
- No new runtime npm dependency without a licence check against `docs/compliance/DEPENDENCY-LICENSES.md`
  and an ADR 0006 note; regenerate `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` and the SBOM in the same PR (CI enforces).
- Planning documents are updated as phases land; status lives in `docs/STATUS.md`, not here.
